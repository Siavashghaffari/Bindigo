# Example Data

This directory will contain example protein and ligand files for testing and demonstration.

## Planned Examples

1. **1HSG** - HIV-1 Protease (PDB ID: 1HSG)
   - Small protein, well-studied
   - Good for testing and tutorials

2. **Example Ligands**
   - Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid)
   - Acetaminophen (paracetamol)
   - Caffeine
   - Small drug-like molecules

## Note

Example files will be added in Phase 2 when preprocessing modules are implemented.
For now, users can:
- Provide their own PDB files
- Use PDB IDs to fetch from RCSB (when implemented)
- Use SMILES strings for ligands
