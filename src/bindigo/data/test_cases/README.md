# Test Cases

This directory will contain protein-ligand test cases with known binding affinities for validation.

## Planned Test Cases

Test cases will include:
- Known protein-ligand complexes from PDBbind
- Experimental binding affinity values
- Used for model validation and benchmarking

## Structure

Each test case will include:
```
test_case_001/
├── protein.pdb
├── ligand.sdf
└── metadata.json (contains experimental Kd/Ki)
```

Test cases will be added during Phase 4 (ML Model development).
